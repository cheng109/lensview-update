1.1     2008/10/14
- changes in 1.0.4 are significant enought to warrant a minor version
  incrememnt.
- fixed a couple of minor memory free errors at program termination
1.0.4   2008/07/08
- fixed a typo that forced the sersic index in sersic models to be 4
  (although the normalisation was changing). Previous sersic models
  should be re-run. Humble apologies. :-(
- create summary usage message if run with no command line args
- more robust pruning of linearly dependent search vectors to remove
  bumps in chi-squared vs parameter space.
- changed default output names to "model_img.fits" and "model_src.fits"
- always write out best model image/source when using minfinder
- change source image to include default source value as part of the source
  brightness, but automatically remove when projecting to image plane.
  This way you can use sky subtracted images as data, but supply the true
  sky background as the default source value, which means the entropy calc
  is more correct for the actual counts/variance in the data. The output
  source planes will now include the sky background and it should be removed
  if necessary.
1.0.3   2007/5/4   Updated usage message. Changed debugging output for SIE
axisratio be to "axisratio", not "ellipticity"
1.0.2   2007/1/8   Fixed bug in calculating external shear deflection angles
1.0.1   2006/11/20 Fixed segfault in log.c when unable to open log file
V1.0    2006/9/17  Initial release
